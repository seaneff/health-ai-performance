sensitivity,"Sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly classify a case as positive (e.g., having some condition or disease). It is also sometimes referred to as the true positive rate or recall.","Parikh R, Mathai A, Parikh S, Chandra Sekhar G, Thomas R.

specificity,"Specificity is the ability of test to correctly classify a case as negative (e.g., not having some condition or disease). It is also sometimes referred to as the true negative rate.","Parikh R, Mathai A, Parikh S, Chandra Sekhar G, Thomas R. Understanding and using sensitivity, specificity and predictive values.

positive predictive value,"Positive predictive value is the percentage of cases with positive test results that actually have the condition being tested for (e.g., the disease or symptoms).

F1,"The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, meaning that it penalizes extreme values of either.

accuracy,Accuracy is the ratio of the correctly classified samples to the total number of samples in the evaluation dataset,"Hicks SA, Strümke I, Thambawita V, Hammou M, Riegler MA, Halvorsen P, et al.

ROC AUC,"The area under the ROC curve (ROC AUC) is a measure how well a test is table to discriminate whether a specific condition is present or not present. An AUC of 0.5 represents a test that performs no better than random chance, while an AUC of 1.0 represents a test with perfect performance. The ROC AUC is calculated by plotting the plotting sensitivity (true positive rate) on the y-axis against 1–specificity (false positive rate) on the x-axis for the various values, and then calculating the area under the curve generated based on those values.","Hoo ZH, Candlish J, Teare D.

precision," Precision is calculated as the proportion of positive test results that were actually positive (e.g., having some disease or symptoms)","Hicks SA, Strümke I, Thambawita V, Hammou M, Riegler MA, Halvorsen P, et al.

Pearson correlation,"Pearson’s correlation coefficient is a measurement quantifying the strength of linear association between two variables. It takes values of −1 through +1, where values of −1 or +1 indicate a perfect linear relationship between two variables, and a value of 0 indicates no linear relationship.
